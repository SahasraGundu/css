units in css
(we have already learned absolute units(px))
relative units


(20px button and div will be of same size)
(percentage)%=but 20% buttton and 20%div varies in size
It is often used to define a size as relative to an element's parent object.
width : 33% ;
margin-left : 50% ;

em
font size of the parent int the case of typographical
properties like font-size and font size of the element
itself,in the case of other properties like width



rem(root em)
font size of the root element

vh:relative to 1% virwport height

vW:relative to 1% viewport width


position:
The position CSS property sets how an element is positioned in a document.

position:staticrelative/asolute/fixed
static - default position (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index properties have no effect)
relative - element is relative to itself. (The top, right, bottom, left, and z-index will work)
absolute - positioned relative to its closest positioned ancestor. (removed from the flow)
fixed - positioned relative to browser. (removed from flow)
sticky - positioned based on user's scroll position


z-index

It decides the stack level of elements

z-index : auto (0)

z-index : 1 / 2 / ...(gets upon and up for positive)

z-index : -1 / -2 / ...(gets down and down for negative)

Overlapping elements with a larger z-index cover those with a smaller one.

if overlapping(firstwritten one gets under and next written one gets on top)

by deafult all the elements z-index is 0

for static we cant do z index

so z-index:1;
it comes up 

if -1
it comes down 



background image 
Used to set an image as background
background-image : url("image.jpeg");

use unsplash website for downloading pics and they are copyright

background size
background-size : cover / contain / auto
cover-sets the image correctly to that element. if image is bigger than box then the image comes upto 
only the size of box

contain-if image is bigger than box then image reduces its size to the size of box

auto-how much it wants it comes(enlarged)
